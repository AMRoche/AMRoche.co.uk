					<h1> Welcome!</h1>
					<p>
						Hi! I'm Alex Roche, a university student and part-time web developer by day, and I.T. multi-talent by night, and this is my website.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the moment it's centred around a hub of content about my qualifications and projects i've worked on.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've also added a blog for when i've got something tech-related on my mind that I want to
						put down in words of one sort or other; thought-provoking or not.
					<p>
					<p>
						Qualifications and projects aside, there's always what i'm up to whenever i'm not working, or working on expanding my knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're not interested in any of that, then there's always what I can do with my time to help you and how to get in touch
						with me if you need anything in the <a href="/contactMe.html">contact me</a> section.
					</p>
