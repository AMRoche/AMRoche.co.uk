							<p>
								I know it seems a strange concept, but i don't take notes. Well, that's a lie really. What I meant was this; I don't document my own development in any meaningful way. I used to write when i was younger, but that was mostly teenage-ey poetry which comes from, well, mostly just existential thoughts and stuff. I'm talking about documenting things you've learnt, or finding things out; i'm much more likely to go "Oh, that's how it's done!", and implement it and then come back to it when or if i need it.
							</p>
							<p>
								This, i know very well, presents quite a few problems. Sending code for somebody to have a read through is a potential nightmare for me; I need to re-read it and comment it just so the other person knows what my train of thought even was and what my code is even doing. It doesn't help that writing it down is just outright tedious, because while i'm explaining my thought process, i end up about twice as far by the time i've finished writing. Hell, i can only manage typing because i can usually keep up with my thoughts and everything stays legible. It only starts becoming an issue when it doesn't fit in my head anymore.
							</p>
							<p>
								As i'm getting older, i'm finding carrying a notebook around with me is becoming more and more useful, if not only as a replacement for a truly horrendous short term memory then as a bucket to catch thoughts in when my mind is overflowing. I can get to a certain point in a project, but then i need to step back and re-frame it mentally. I'm fine once i have it all in my mind mentally, but up until that point, i'm lost. Writing it down also doesn't seem to make much sense; All i could do for programs are just straight up UML diagrams anyways, and even then it doesn't seem to make as much sense as it does in my head.

						<span> <h2 class = "center"> Computing Power </h2> <span id = "l">AMRoche</span><span id = "r">Friday, October 7, 2011</span> </span>
						<br>
						<span>
							<p>
								Well. Here I am again, on a computer that was old and close to being out of date when i got it. Need i say more. My new laptop has around 16 times more VRam and an i5 instead of an intel Celeron. It's going to be quite the jump. With it sitting in the back of a UPS truck as i type this on its' way to me in South East London, i thought i might consider the relevancy of Moore's Law and Computing Power in the modern day.
							</p>
							<p>
								While Moore's Law specifies that transistor quantity per unit space doubles every 24 months in processors, surely there's a point whereby Moore's Law becomes merely a technological benchmark and not a useful standard for the performance of computers. I'll cite one example; Starting up GIMP and NetBeans java IDE on this Celeron powered laptop, and starting it on a dual core laptop. The difference is noticable and indeed a vast difference, however only on the Celeron was i actually frustrated by how long it took to start up. The dual core machine, surely behind Moore's Law, was still palatably fast and not obviously annoying, until it came down with motherboard issues, but that's another, rather unrelated issue.
							</p>
							<p>
								This leads to actually wondering what constitutes an annoyance in regards to computing power. From a gaming and programming point of view, i would argue that if it takes a 3D render an inordinately long time to render, or you can't play a particular game (in my case Portal 2), then it is seen as an annoyance. However, i would argue that this is caused by knowing that much better than what we have at the moment is possible, and hence we become frustrated because we are not able to 'keep up' with the newest technologies. Had we only had what was available in 1995 to use on our computers, well we'd never want for more because we'd not know better existed.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, like Pandora's box, what has been opened can't be shut anymore, and developers code for the systems that are the median. This means that as long as i'm working on my 1.7 Gigahertz, 128 Megabyte video RAM antiquated piece, which has survived far too much and is far too reliable, i'll be behind the times. Sure, i'm looking forwards to getting my new laptop, but on the other hand, were i not in to gaming or computing like i am, i highly doubt i would be so fervently looking to obtain a new standard of technology, because i just wouldn't need it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Despite the major increases described by Moore's Law, there is a 'Murphy's Law' of computing, which negates Moore's Law by implying any computational benefits obtained vanish because of the bloat in mainstream (i.e. word processing) programs themselves. It seems that this would imply that the only gains to be made are where the hardware is being used for raw computational power for rendering or calculations (gaming or compiling and running code, to name 2 examples).
							</p>
							<p>
								Moore's Law, of itself, is a nice benchmark to have. However, according to Gordon Moore himself, it cannot last more than two to three more generations as we get ever closer to the atomic level of computing. Until that point, however, we'll have a nice run and can look forwards to capacitor density increasing exponentially. Whether this means computers are going to become outdated quicker than ever is yet to be seen, however judging from the last 2 decades, we have seen incredible changes in processing and graphical power, which nobody could have predicted and indeed will be able to predict the true extent thereof in the coming years.
							</p>
							<p>
								Despite all of this, i'm not going to lie and i'm going to still be drooling over my laptop once it arrives, and will probably be raving about it in my next post.

						<span> <h2 class = "center"> The Wake of the Departed Lulz Boat </h2> <span id = "l">AMRoche</span><span id="r">Friday, July 1, 2011</span> </span>
						<br>
						<span>
							<p>
								LulzSec, well, where to start. Apparently for the last 50 days, they've been roaming the seas, pillaging and firing their "lulz cannon". No matter how lulzy their escapades have been at times though, looking back on their actions, they seem to have only left a wake of burning debris and annoyed computer literates.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yes, sure, they've shown sony and everyone that they can hack and that they can cause chaos, but let's be honest; Anonymous was doing that before LulzSec and, recently at least, have shown some moral fibre about their hacktivism. Lulzsec, on the other hand, has been just annoying the people who comprise their main supporter base in the first place, alienating them by taking down login servers for online games such as League of Legends, Minecraft and Eve online. Now, i could go on for a while about what LulzSec got up to (and indeed how lulzy it was), but i think the more important aspect to look at is the legacy of their actions.
							</p>
							<p>
								Well, with the Lulzboat now sailed off in to the setting sun for whatever reason, they leave more than debris in their wake. What I think the industry should be taking away from this is that people are not necessarily anywhere near as safe as they think they are. The differing estimates of LulsSec's abilities are mostly irrelevant; the point is they still managed to cause a level of chaos and throw people off their certainties. Particularly with the ammount of personal data LulzSec managed to obtain, i think there's lessons involved for users as well, among other things to have different passwords for each web service they use, same email address or username or not. Even i'm guilty of this, but it's still food for thought and rather powerful when someone you don't know posts personal pictures (read, intimate pictures) to your twitter and facebook from information that people you don't know obtained from websites you trusted to keep your information safe.
							</p>
							<p>
								People, as a whole, tend to forget themselves on the internet and do things that they wouldn't normally do and take risks. To a certain extent, humanity is still only just getting used to the wealth of information at their fingertips and having to keep themselves safe in cyberspace. Information in itself isn't dangerous, but what we can do with it can be, whether to governments or innocent people, devastating. Exactly because of this danger, people need to realise how easy it can be to destroy their cyberspace personalities.
							</p>
							<p>
								On a final note; LulzSec remind me mostly of misguided revolutionaries who, with a better grasp of common good instead of sheer lulz, would have managed great things. Then again, maybe they were literally only ever in it for "the Lulz".
