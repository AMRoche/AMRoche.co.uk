						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<p>
							Hi there! I'm Alex Roche. I'm a 21 year old
							london-based freelancer who has a thing for object-oriented programming with Java and Processing, as well as
							building websites with HTML, CSS and PHP (working on JavaScript, I promise!), with knowledge of mySQL
							thrown in for good measure. At the same time i'm completing a three year course at
							<a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk">Goldsmiths College of London</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							With my websites and designs,
							I aspire to create a clean and interesting site while maintaining an easy-to-read and minimalist
							page layout, so your clients don't need to spend hours searching for a factoid that should be
							easily found and even easier to understand.
						</p>
						<p>
							Away from strict work, I can be found attanding hackdays and programming some weird frankenstein creation.
							Ignoring the programming environments, however, and i'm an avid computer gamer, consuming
							everything from Bastion to Battlefront 2 and most things in between. Computer aside, I enjoy getting
							out and about, cycling, playing the occasional rugby match and spending time with friends, whether
							it be in a pub or battling dragons and exploring dungeons!
						</p>
						<p>
							If you've now read through to the end of this and think I can help you, feel free to <a href="contactMe.html">drop me a line!</a>
						</p>
