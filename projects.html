						<h1> What's in the works at the moment </h1>
						<p>
							At the moment, I'm working for <a href="http://www.welikepie.com">WeLikePie</a> as part of the web team
							developing new features for the <a href="http://www.eventhandler.co.uk">EventHandler</a> website, amongst the 
							many other hats I also end up wearing on occasion.
						</p>
						<h1>Completed Projects</h1>
						<h2>AMRoche.co.uk</h2>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.amroche.co.uk">AMRoche.co.uk homepage</a>
							<p>
								Yup, this website. I've done my best to keep it clean and easy to read, so that you can
								find out everything you need to know quickly and easily. It's coded mainly in CSS and HTML,
								with a touch of gratuitous PHP thrown in for the forms.
								<h2>No ce pas un Dictateur</h2>
								<li>
									<a href="http://soundcloud.com/alexander-michael-roche/19-05-2012-charlie-chaplin">Sound produced </a>
								<li>
									<a href="http://vimeo.com/42460135">Proof of concept video</a>
									<p>
										This one was interesting, mainly because of the time constraints that we had to work in.
										The result of a crazed frenzy of nearly 30 hours of coding, myself and a small team at the
										Ravensbourne sponsored music techfest. The video is a proof of concept of a system which, upon
										receiving video of a speech as input, synthesises both a realtime animation over the speaker's
										face and processes the sound real-time to produce acompanying music.
										<h2>Project ChivalRick</h2>
										<li>
											<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iqpe-Z3mkona7dmqSLB8akMQg1Fktl6p9XXvPEMP4ZQ/edit#heading=h.wyld91hscc5u">Project Proposal</a>
											<p>
												The result of a session of brainstorming which resulted in a concept for an action tower defense game,
												similar in concept to defense grid. While we didn't have the manpower to implement the game to our original
												specifications, we were still able to produce a functioning game. Chivalrick itself is a third person action
												tower defense game in a medieval setting; you control a player character who can both attack and place towers
												to defend a castle from waves of enemies.
											</p>
											<h2>HTML 1 compliant browser</h2>
											<p>
												The challenge here was to write a web browser which worked using only Java. To this extent
												there isn't a particularly good web rendering engine, but all of the standard tools are there
												such as a favorites list, browsing history, tabbed browsing and even a page source code editor.
												Too bad it won't see production any time soon or posting for downloading without a lot more elbow
												grease and polish.
											</p>
											<h2>Project Applespinner</h2>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzwheTNFhpE">Low Quality video of the application running</a>
										<li>
											<a href="http://applespinner.tumblr.com/">Project Blog</a>
											<p>
												A small project originally intended to be a DJ app for iPhone, but after dificulties with platform cross-
												compatibility and testing on an apple device was transformed
												in to a standalone Windows piece. Sadly, the end functionality is that the application can load samples and add effects to each sample
												individually and that's about it, owing to a catastrophic failure of the sound library that was intended
												for the project.
											</p>
											<h2>Project Synaptix</h2>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj6YRFB1Vdw">Low quality video of the application running</a>
											<p>
												This piece was a first year university project which, upon completion was a standalone music
												visualisation application which would receive audio and, based on that audio, produce a
												visualisation which could be toggled.
											</p>
											<h2>Shoot 'em up</h2>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYF5avyDKvw">Low quality video of application running</a>
											<p>
												Another basic first year project which was a challenge along the lines of writing our own computer game.
												In my case, it's turret based and the player has to defend his spot from enemies coming increasingly
												quickly from four dfferent sides.
											</p>
											<h2>Keyboard</h2>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmG8IUPCpik">Low quality video of application running</a>
											<p>
												This basic piece written in a maxMSP derivative allows the user to play notes as they would on a
												piano using their keyboard.

								If you would like to see the source code or have a copy of any of these projects,
								I don't guarantee they make sense or follows decent

							<p>
								As for the video,
								it is sadly the result of screen capturing on a very old, very underpowered computer which took
								most of the libraries and source code used to create these with it when it died.
